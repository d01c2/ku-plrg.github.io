Welcome to **Programming Language Research Group (PLRG)** at **Korea University**!
{:.success}

Our research goal is to help developers design and implement high-quality
software using diverse _programming language_ technologies.

Especially our research interests are as follows:
- **program analysis** for automatically understanding program behaviors and
  detecting bugs and vulnerabilities.
- **mechanized specification** to fill the gap between human-readable
  specifications and machine-friendly software.
- **program synthesis** to lessen the burden of software development by
  automatically generating programs.
- **automated testing** to generate test cases for software automatically on
  behalf of humans.

We are actively recruiting motivated graduate/undergraduate students and
postdocs. For more detailed information, please see [Research](/research) and
[Publications](/publications).
