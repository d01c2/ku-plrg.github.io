  abstract = {JavaScript has been the language for web applications, and the growing prevalence of web environments in various devices makes JavaScript web applications even more ubiquitous. However, because JavaScript and web environments are extremely dynamic, JavaScript web applications are often vulnerable to type-related errors and security attacks. To lessen the problem, researchers have developed various analysis techniques in different analyzers, but such analyzers are not especially aimed for ease of use by analysis developers. In this paper, we present SAFE 2.0, a scalable analysis framework for ECMAScript especially designed as a playground for advanced research in JavaScript web applications. SAFE 2.0 is light-weight, which supports pluggability, extensibility, and debuggability.Demo video: https://youtu.be/ZI_emiRMoxQ},
