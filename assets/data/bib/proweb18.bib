  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) allows various things like mobile devices and electronic appliances to communicate over network. Inter-device apps can share data between devices and dispatch specific tasks to other devices to utilize their resources. The prevalence of JavaScript web apps that can run anywhere providing any browsers opens the gate to unanticipated interactions between devices. However, the current techniques require developers construct tasks to dispatch statically with strong consistency, and they do not provide any disciplined way to develop inter-device apps. In this paper, we propose IDTD (Inter-Device Task Dispatch), a framework that allows developers to construct and dispatch tasks into multiple devices dynamically with eventual consistency in a systematic manner. We provide a high-level architecture of IDTD, prove the soundness and eventual consistency of the framework, and present its practical usability.},
